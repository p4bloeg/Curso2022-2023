        <h1>Application Requirements</h1>
        <!--p>An HTML document that specifies the requirements of the application that will be built, with user interface
            mock-ups</p-->
        <p>The application intents the collection, harmonisation and enable the analytical processing of a large number
            of datasets belonging to different departments of the Catalan administration whose KPIs are to be displayed
            in a dashboard.</p>
        <p>Reporting and tracking of buildings energy performance is the main objective of the app which includes not only
        simple tracking but also basic longitudinal and cross-sectional benchmarking.</p>

    <h2>Mock-ups</h2>
    <h3>Simple Tracking</h3>
    <p>"Monthly or annual energy use totals are recorded either at the whole-building, system, or end-use level. You can
        use either utility billing data or interval meter data to quantify energy use totals. You can present these
        totals either in tables or plots, and examine them over time for irregularities or large increases or decreases
        in use that might indicate operational or efficiency problems. Simple tracking does not involve normalization of
        energy use data, as might be true of other analysis methods."</p>
    <p>Energy consumption is plotted for a calendar year, for two retrofit buildings.
        Energy use in the year before a retrofit is plotted with a dashed line.
        Energy use in the year after a retrofit is shown with a solid line.</p>

    <p>Submetered electric end use is plotted for a calendar year in a stacked bar chart. The height of each bar shows
        the total electric use for the month. Each end use is represented with a different color. The size of the
        colored portion of each bar represents end use energy total.</p>

    <h3>Basic Longitudinal Benchmarking</h3>
    <p>"Characterize energy use in the base, or reference, period with a simple or model-based baseline and express it
        according to your metric of choice, forming a “benchmark.” Then track energy performance relative to the base-period
        benchmark. Annual whole-building benchmarking is most common, with kilowatt-hours per square foot per year (kWh/sf-yr)
        taken as the associated usage metric; however, longitudinal benchmarking may also be conducted seasonally and for
        systems and equipment."</p>
    <p>Heating energy for an academic building is plotted on the y-axis in therms/sf-yr. Each bar represents total
        heating energy for the prior 12-month period.</p>

    <h3>Basic Cross-Sectional Benchmarking</h3>
    <p>"Total building energy use (typically annually) and express it according to a metric of interest, such as kWh/sf/yr.
        Normalize the energy use for parameters such as weather, operation hours, and other factors, and compare it to
        that of other buildings. A simple normalization approach is to directly filter the peer group for buildings with
        similar characteristics to the building being benchmarked. A more rigorous approach is to conduct a regression
        analysis on the peer data set, which yields an equation that relates the performance metric to normalizing parameters."</p>

    <p>Scores from 16 buildings are shown on a bar chart, sorted from low to high.</p>
    <p>The filtering feature includes categories such as types of buildings, organizations, climatic zone and more.</p>

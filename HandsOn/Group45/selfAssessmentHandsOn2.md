The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with the first steps in the Linked Data generation process.

The students will have to take their selected dataset(s) and perform the following tasks:

Analyse Data Set. Analyse both the data (quantities, value ranges, etc.) as well as the schema of the data.
Analyse Licensing of the Data Source. Analyse who is the publisher of the dataset and its rightsholder, as well as the licence of the dataset. Define the potential license to be used for the dataset to be generated.
Define Resource Naming Strategy. Define the resource naming strategy to be followed for the ontology and the data to be generated (URI form, content negotiation, URIs domain, path, patterns, etc.).
Develop Ontology. Develop a lightweight ontology that includes the classes and properties (with their domains and ranges) to be used with the dataset. The rest of ontological components (e.g., restrictions) are optional for this assignment.

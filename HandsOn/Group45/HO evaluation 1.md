    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The resource naming strategy is not correct.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, there are object properties (where value of the property is a resource) and datatype properties (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed). The ontology right now does not have datatype properties, which is wrong.
        - Ranges are missing in properties.
        - The resource naming strategy is not correctly applied.
    RDF data

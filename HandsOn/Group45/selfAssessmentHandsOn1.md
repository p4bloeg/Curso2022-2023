The goal of this assignment is to find some datasets that can be used by the students in different assignments during the rest of the course and to specify the application that they want to build on top of the datasets.

The selected datasets will be the one that the students will transform into RDF, link with other datasets, and publish online.

The students have to search in the Web for a dataset that satisfies the following requirements:

R1. Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.
R2. Data are available as a CSV file.
R3. Data have an open license so they can be published.
R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).
R5. Documentation exists for the data (optional).
R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional).

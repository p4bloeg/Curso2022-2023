    Ontology
        - Do not create the ontology by hand.
        - Review the SSN terms; not all of them are correctly defined.
        - In OWL, there are object properties (where value of the property is a resource) and datatype properties (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed). The ontology only contains object properties, which is wrong.
    RDF data
        - Dates are not properly encoded.

    <h4><strong>URI Strategy</strong></h4>
    <p><br />Content Negotiation:<br /><br />The application will handle content negotiation with ease, using "/" for resources and "#" for classes/properties, in case of a request the response will redirect to a related page or by default will download the ontology.</p>
    <p>Pattern URI for resources:<br />http://www.semanticweb_g27.org/resource/{Class_name}/{resource_id}</p>
    <p>- The id will be the identifier provided by the dataset followed by a capital letter.</p>
    <p>- In case that the dataset doesn't provide an identifier, a random 8-digit number will be applied instead.</p>
    <p>Pattern URI for Classes and Properties:</p>
    <p>http://www.semanticweb_g27.org/ontology/EnergyCons#[{Class_name} | {Property_name}]</p>
    <p>- The name for the ontology is "EnergyCons".</p>
    <p>- The class name starts with a capital letter.</p>
    <p>- Properties name starts with <span class="VIiyi" lang="en"><span class="JLqJ4b ChMk0b"><span class="Q4iAWc">lowercase.</span></span></span></p>
